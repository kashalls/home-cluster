# The `ingress` block tells cloudflared which local service to route incoming
# requests to. For more about ingress rules, see
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ingress
#
# Remember, these rules route traffic from cloudflared to a local service. To route traffic
# from the internet to cloudflared, run `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`.
# E.g. `cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com`.
