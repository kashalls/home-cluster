## What is this?

This is the repository I use to version control my kubernetes cluster I deploy and maintain at home. I currently use [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) to provide a secure, minimal and immutable environment for Kubernetes. Previous iterations of this repository relied on Debian-based Operating Systems which can lead unwanted changes in the base system.

## How did you do this?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is the [cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to easily get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join the community [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.

### Directory Helper

This repository uses the following layout for [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ bootstrap
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù helmfile.yaml # Helmreleases required to run bootstrap flux.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù secrets.yaml.tpl # Secrets required to bootstrap flux.
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps # Per-cluster application-specific configurations.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ components # Flux & Talos configurations for setting up the cluster.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux # Flux configuration, application repositories and more.
üìÅ talos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ nodes # Override configurations for each individual node.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù machineconfig.yaml.j2 # Base configuration for all nodes.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù talos.env # Kubernetes and Talos Version Variables
üìÅ unifi # Configuration files for UniFi
üìù kubeconfig
üìù talosconfig
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

### üåê DNS

UniFi released a new feature update with UniFi routers that allow you to create custom dns records to be served to the whole network. I wrote [External DNS Unifi Webhook](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook) to allow [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) to gather service and ingress hosts from my clusters and deploy the records to my routers local dns server without any extra local resolvers or moving parts.
