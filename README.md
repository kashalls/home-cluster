## Kashall's Home Operations

- [⚡️ Clone Flux Cluster Template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template)


## What is this?

Arisu is the name of the kubernetes cluster I deployed at home. It features a couple of low power consumer machines running [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server) with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) deployed using my [ansible configuration](/ansible/).

This repo serves as the "roadmap" that is automatically updated and deployed thanks to [renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) and [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io/).

## How did you do this?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is the [flux cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join the community [Discord](https://discord.com): [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.
