## What is this?

This is the repository I use to version control my kubernetes clusters I deploy and maintain at home. I currently use [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) to provide a secure, minimal and immutable environment for Kubernetes. Previous iterations of this repository relied on Debian-based Operating Systems which can lead unwanted changes in the base system.

## How did you do this?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is the [cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to easily get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join the community [Discord](https://discord.com): [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.

### Directory Helper

This repository uses the following layout for [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes
└── 📁 {cluster}
   ├── 📁 apps # Per-cluster application-specific configurations.
   ├── 📁 bootstrap # Flux & Talos configurations for setting up the cluster.
   ├── 📁 flux # Flux configuration, application repositories and more.
   ├── 📝 kubeconfig # Kubernetes Certificate
   └── 📝 talosconfig # Talos Certificate
```

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

### 🌐 DNS

UniFi released a new feature update with UniFi routers that allow you to create custom dns records to be served to the whole network. I wrote[External DNS Unifi Webhook](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook) to allow [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) to gather service and ingress hosts from my clusters and deploy the records without any extra local resolvers.
