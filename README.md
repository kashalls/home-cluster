## What is this?

This is the home of the kubernetes cluster I deployed at home. It features a couple of low power consumer machines running [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/) with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) deployed using my [ansible configuration](/ansible/).

This repo serves as the "roadmap" that is automatically updated and deployed thanks to [renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) and [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io/).

## How did you do this?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is the [cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to easily get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join the community [Discord](https://discord.com): [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ main
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ storage

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ config
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ repositories
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ vars
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

| Service                                         | Use                                                               | Cost           |

### üìÆ Routing

I use [VyOS](https://vyos.io/) as my current routing operating system.
Previous solutions I had used consisted of [OPNSense](https://opnsense.org/), and the [Unifi Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/products/udm-pro).

Here's a couple repositories to show my current/past configurations for these solutions.
- [kashalls/vyos-config](https://github.com/kashalls/vyos-config)
- [kashalls/udmp-utils](https://github.com/Kashalls/udmp-utils)

### üåê DNS

My current setup consists of [bind9](https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9) and [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/) deployed as containers on [VyOS](https://vyos.io/). I currently point all DNS to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, and I am planning on intergrating nextdns in the future.

My kubernetes clusters interact with bind9 using the `RFC2136` standard to sync DNS records.
