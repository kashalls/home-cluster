## What is this?

Arisu is the name of the kubernetes cluster I deployed at home. It features a couple of low power consumer machines running [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server) with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) deployed using my [ansible configuration](/ansible/).

This repo serves as the "roadmap" that is automatically updated and deployed thanks to [renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) and [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io/).

## How did you do this?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is the [flux cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join on [Discord](https://discord.com) with [https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.

## Cluster Specifics

Interested in seeing what my cluster is like? Check out the [documentation](https://home-cluster.pages.dev) where I try to detail the configurations of devices as well as general layout for how everything is connected. I often buy weird devices like LTE modems to intergrate into my cluster, just for fun.
