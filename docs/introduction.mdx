## What is this?

This documentation accompanies my version controlled homelab where I self host many services which which either better or worsen my life.
I've had many iterations of my homelab and this site will document my encounters to help others own the road.

## How does your home operations work?

We use an open source and extensible continuous delivery system called [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
It's actually called "Flux2", but most of the community refers to it as "Flux".

Flux is simply a tool that ensures that the Kubernetes cluster it is managing stays in sync with the configurations presenting in this repository.

We use other tools like [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to watch for dependency updates and automatically create new pull requests.
When these pull requests are merged, Flux will automatically apply the changes to the cluster.

## Neat, How do I start my own?

Thanks to [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p), there is a [cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) that allows you to easily get started with your own kubernetes cluster at home. You don't need to have multiple computers or a fancy setup to get one working.

If you're interested, you can also join and talk wit the community: [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations). Several people are involved daily and it makes for some interesting conversations.
