<Warning>
  This requires a unreleased version (v1.23) of the Minisforum MS-01 Bios.
</Warning>

## Requirements
- A **32GB or Smaller** USB
- You'll need to disable secure boot in order to flash the bios.

## Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Disable Secure Boot">
    Before flashing the bios, Minisforum requires us to disable Secure Boot. This can be accomplished by entering the bios and entering the Secure Boot tab.

    - Change `Secure Boot Mode` to `Custom`.
    - Change `Secure Boot` to `Disabled`.
    - Save and Exit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your USB">
    We need to flash a FAT32 filesystem to your USB drive.

    **You will lose all the data on that USB drive**, so don't use one you care about.

    After formatting your USB, copy the contents of the v1.25 bios update.
