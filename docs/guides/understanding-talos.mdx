## About Talos

> Talos Linux is Linux designed for Kubernetes â€“ secure, immutable, and minimal.
>
> *Developed by [Siderolabs](https://www.siderolabs.com/)*

### Why *should*  you use Talos?
- Talos is a container optimized linux distro; it is designed to be as minimal as possible while still maintaining practicality.
- Talos allows customization through the means of a machine config file that is generated along with the secrets needed to authenticate with your cluster.
- Talos will always end up configured exactly the same every time (it is immutable).
- Talos can be managed declaritively just like kubernetes. Making it easier to automate and maintain at scale.

### Why *shouldn't*  I used Ubuntu or Debian?
- Debian-based Operating Systems are designed to be a general-purpose operating system.
- Higher attack surface. Ubuntu server is a full linux distribution with a shell, multiple packages and services enabled by default. It is harder to guarantee that the system running kubernetes hasn't been tampered with.
- For larger clusters, managing nodes will require more complex configurations, automation, and oversight.


## Getting Started with Talos

### Prerequisites
Almost all of the configuration will be over the Command-Line Interface or `CLI` for short.

I highly recommend installing [homebrew/brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it installed. Updating `talosctl` manually is difficult and tiring.

If you have homebrew installed, you can install `talosctl` via:

```bash
brew install siderolabs/tap/talosctl
```

Windows users can also use the brew command above if brew is installed, otherwise you can download the latest `talosctl` binary from [here](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/) and put it in your `$PATH` each time it updates.

### Building Your Factory Image

Talos provides this awesome factory that helps configure and package various boot assets required for each node: https://factory.talos.dev/

The factory will guide you through creating the ideal image for your node by configuring:
- The Hardware Type
- Talos Version
- Architecture
- Secure Boot
- Extensions

### Flashing Your Image

Assuming you have somehow managed to coerce your machine into booting from the ISO, Talos will be running in *mainteance* mode. It is running in RAM and will not install itself to any disk without a configuration.


### Finding Your Disks

While your machine is in *mainteance mode*, you can use the `CLI` to fetch details about the machine. You will need to use the `--insecure` flag as the machine does not have any configuration associated with it.

```bash
talosctl disks -n <your_node_ip> -e <your_node_ip> --insecure
```

Here is the output if the machine has Talos installed:
```
NODE        DEV            MODEL                      SERIAL             TYPE   UUID                                   WWID                                                                   MODALIAS   NAME   SIZE     BUS_PATH                                                   SUBSYSTEM          READ_ONLY   SYSTEM_DISK

```

### Scouring Your Talos Filesystem

`talosctl` provides the `read`, `list` & `copy` commands for looking and pulling information from the filesystem.

This is particularly helpful for searching for the disk id's for your drives when setting up a storage engine like [longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) or [rook-ceph](https://rook.io).

### Accessing The Node (through other means)

In the case you need to interact with the node, you can create a privileged pod and enter an interactive session with it using the `kubectl` tool.

```bash
kubectl run toolbox --image=debian:latest --privileged=true -it
```

- `-i` will keep the output open regardless if nothing is attached.
- `-t` will allocate a output for the container.
