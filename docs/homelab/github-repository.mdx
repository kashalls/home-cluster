You don't have to build your gitops homelab around github. There are plenty of people who use GitLab or other git-based providers.
Flux lists their bootstrap providers on [their documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-providers).

In my case, I am using Github.

## Configuration

### Action > Repository Secrets

These are required if you are using my workflow actions to automate some tasks in your cluster.

`BOT_*` secrets are required if you are using a custom github application with your actions.
All of these values will be located at your [application's settings](https://github.com/settings/apps/).

`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` optional as they allow the `schemas.yaml` action to publish schematics to some of the cluster resources.
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` has the permissions `Account / Cloudflare Pages / Edit` and `User / User Details / Read`.

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOT_APP_ID            | The github application id.                                   |
| BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY   | A base64 encoded private key from your application.          |
| BOT_USERNAME          | Your bot's literal username.                                 |
| CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID | Found on any domain's overview page under Account ID.        |
| CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN  | Create one at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens |
| KUBECONFIG            | A base64 encoded kubeconfig generated from your cluster.     |

### Self Hosted Runners

I self-host an [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) in my cluster.
This helps run some sensitive workflows inside my cluster and doesn't require me to expose it to the outside world.

You'll need to provide roughly the same information as listed above.

### Webhook(s)

I utilize Flux's [Webhook Receivers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/webhook-receivers/).
By design, flux is **pull-based**, meaning it runs on an interval unless told to pull otherwise.

You can utilize these receivers to make super responsive **push-based** pipelines.

Some specific settings:
- `Content type`: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- `SSL Verification`: Enabled
- `Which events?`: Just push.

### Deploy Keys

Flux uses [Deploy Keys](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/github/#github-deploy-keys) to allow bootstraping flux over SSH instead of HTTPS.
I don't really use it for this as I have a whole system already revolving around HTTP/S.
I instead use it for ImagePolicy(s) as Flux is configured to check for specific application updates faster that Renovate is.
This is mostly for me when I am developing an application and I don't want to keep pushing the same commit to update the digest.
