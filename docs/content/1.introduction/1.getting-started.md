# Getting Started

## Start your own :badge[Recommended]

If you're looking to start your very own cluster, I highly recommend checking out this: [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template). The repo is heavily based upon this and will get you started with your own cluster at home.

## Fork my setup :badge[Not Recommended]{type="danger"}

If you're looking to deploy my cluster, you will have some work to do. You will need to follow these steps, then you will have to delete all of the `secret.sops.yaml` and create the new secrets with your configs.

Fork [kashalls/home-cluster](https://github.com/kashalls/home-cluster/fork) and clone it to your computer. You'll need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template#-lets-go).

If you have questions pertaining to my setup, [open an issue](https://github.com/Kashalls/home-cluster/issues).
