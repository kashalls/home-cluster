## Prepping Our Hosts

- Install the latest version of [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server), you can use bleeding edge if you like.
- When installing, set a static ip and configure a hostname to match the role this node will have. An appropriate example would be `kube-master-01` for a master node and `kube-worker-01` for a worker node. This is not required, it just makes identifying your nodes easier.
- Opt for a minimalized build, where most packages are removed for machines that have no users logging in.
- Enable SSH


## Installing Kubernetes

Everyone who knows me knows me to be the one person who does everything the hard way. The first time I attempted installing kubernetes I did it by hand and when I screwed up, I would just repeat the process.

As of current, my cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned on bare-metal servers using the [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role: [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s).
