## Installing Kubernetes

Everyone who knows me knows me to be the one person who does everything the hard way. The first time I attempted installing kubernetes I did it by hand and when I screwed up, I would just repeat the process.

As of current, my cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned on bare-metal servers using the [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role: [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s).
