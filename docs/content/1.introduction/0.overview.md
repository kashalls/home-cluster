# Overview

### Welcome to [Project Arisu](https://github.com/kashalls/home-cluster)!

Project Arisu is an internal codename that I use for my kubernetes cluster at home.
This project is heavily influnced based on what kind of things I want to run at the time, so changes are quite frequent. Feel free to shoot me an email at [pm@kashall.dev](mailto:pm@kashall.dev) or contact me in the [k8s@home discord server](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home).

This documentation showcases my particular setup which uses tools like [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io), [renovate](https://renovatebot.com), [github](https://github.com), [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to update, test and deploy changes from this repository in real-time.
