# Hello There

Welcome to my documentation for my home cluster!
It's plastered together with lots of hot glue managed with [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io), [renovate](https://renovatebot.com), and [github](https://github.com).

    Checkout the [k8s@home discord guild](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home)!

This is a mono repository for my home kubernetes cluster. If you want to look at some of the scripts I run on my [Unifi Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro), go check out my [udmp-utils](https://github.com/Kashalls/udmp-utils) repository. Although I have a mind of my own, I tend to follow practices set by the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) community.
