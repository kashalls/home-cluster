# Git Ops

## Flux
Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

It watches the [cluster](https://github.com/Kashalls/home-cluster/tree/main/kubernetes) folder and makes changes to cluster based on the manifest I allow it to find.

I currently have it configured to search the top-most `kustomization.yaml` and load in all resources listed in it.

## Renovate

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) is a nifty service I got recommended shortly after starting working on my own cluster. It watches the entire repository looking for any updates for my dependencies. It automagically creates a `Pull Request`. Once merged, `flux` automatically applies the changes to the cluster.
